# pythonAPI-challenge

needs api_keys.py in the VacationPy and VacationPy folders.  I put api_keys.py into .gitignore, so it is not tracked by github.  
But you will need to create the api_keys.py file if you want to run the notebooks.

content of api_keys.py

# OpenWeatherMap API Key
weather_api_key = "xxxxxx"

# Google API Key
g_key = "xxxxxxx"
